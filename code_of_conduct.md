*This document describes our team social contract for this project*

Roles
- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster

Daily process
- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
- New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
- Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Update Waffle
- Work on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

Team expectations
- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If we’re working outside of normal hours, we will communicate this to our team members to prevent double work
- If you have a blocking issue, Slack before interrupting another’s FLOW
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- We will respect each other’s preferences and ideas (i.e. no interruptions!)
- Inform the group when you change what you are working on

Issues
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
- Take a 10-15 minute break
- List out the pros / cons
- Vote on it

If you are frustrated
- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
